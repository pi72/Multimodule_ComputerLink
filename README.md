## Introduction
This code is to control a small drone by a computer through a Multimodule unit. Multimodule unit has got the protocole for a lot of the small drones. See https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module.  
In the next stage a leapmotion sensor will be used for gesture flying (coming soon).
